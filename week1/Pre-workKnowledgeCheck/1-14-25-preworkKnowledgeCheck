[Problem 2] - Loop n Times
Write a function named loopThrough that takes an argument that is a number and loops through and prints a message “Hello World” that number of times.

Bonus: After each "Hello world" exept the last add a comma. Example loopThrough(3) = Hello world, Hello world, Hello world

[Problem 4] - Working with Objects
Create an object called Person which has the name of a person as a string, and their age as a number. The Person object should have a method called describe which returns a string with the following syntax: "name, age years old". So for example, if John is 19 years old then the function describe of his object will return "John, 19 years old".

[Problem 5] - Math.random
Review the Math.random fuction here and write a function with an if statement that console.log's "Over 1.5" if Math.random returns a number greater than 1.5 Otherwise console.log "Under 1.5".

[Problem 6] - Splice method
In the examples below, use splice to convert the first array to the second array:

[2, 3, 4, 5] ---> [2, 4, 5]

["alpha", "gamma", "delta"] ---> ["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta"]

[10,-10,-5,-3,2,1] ---> [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

[Problem 7] - While Loops
