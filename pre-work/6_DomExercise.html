Or in Chrome you can use the menu bar by doing File -> Open.
As you add JS code to the file, you can refresh the page and see your code take effect.
You can also type your JS code in the Console tab of Chrome Developer Tools to see it take effect.

Note: Usually you would put your HTML and JS in separate files, but for simplicity we're 
putting them in the same file for this exercise.

Read through the HTML code given, then scroll down to the exercises below.
Type your JavaScript code for each exercise below each exercise description.
For this exercise, don't change the HTML code given.

<html>
  <body>
    Animals:
    <ol id="ol1">
      <li>Frog</li>
      <li>Dog</li>
      <li>Bunny</li>
    </ol>

    <div id="id1">
      <p>This is the text in div id1</p>
      <p>Hope you enjoy my HTML</p>
    </div>

    <p id="id2">Here's some text in a paragraph</p>

    <div class="myClass">I love learning about HTML and JavaScript</div>

    <p class="myClass">Coding is fun</p>

    <button id="button1">Button 1</button>
    <br /><br />
    <button id="button2">Button 2</button>
  </body>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Exercise 1: Select the element with id "id2" and change the text inside it to "Here's some new text"
    let id2ChangeElement = document.getElementById("id2");
    id2ChangeElement.innerText = "Here's some new text";
    // Exercise 2: Select the element with id "id1" and make the text inside it green.
    let id1ChangeElement = document.getElementById("id1").style.color = "green";
    // Exercise 3: Select the elements that have the class "myClass". console.log the output.
    let myClassOutput = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");
    for(let i = 0; i < myClassOutput.length; i++){
      console.log(myClassOutput[i]);
    }  
    // Exercise 4: Select the children of the element with id "id1". console.log the output.
    let idParentElement = document.getElementById("id1");
    let childrenElement = idParentElement.children;
    for(let i = 0; i < childrenElement.length; i++){
      console.log(childrenElement[i]);
    }  
    // Exercise 5: Select all list items on the page. console.log the output.
    let listItemsOutput = document.getElementsByTagName("li");
    for(let i = 0; i < listItemsOutput.length; i++){
      console.log(listItemsOutput[i].innerText);
    }  
    // Exercise 6: Use JavaScript to find the *number* of list items on the page. console.log the output.
    console.log(listItemsOutput.length);
    // Exercise 7: Using JavaScript, create a list item and add it to the end of the ordered list.
    //get orderedlist 
    let orderedList = document.getElementById("ol1");
    let addItem = document.createElement("li");
    addItem.innerText = "Penguins";
    orderedList.appendChild(addItem);
    // Exercise 8: Using JavaScript, make it so that when button1 is clicked,
    // an alert pops up saying "Hi from Techtonica".
    let button1 = document.getElementById("button1");
    button1.addEventListener('click', function(){
      alert ( "Hi from Techtonica");
    })
    // Exercise 9: In your own words, write a few sentences explaining what the DOM is. Write your answer in a comment below:
    // Dom is allowing the javascript side to get the elements from HTML, and allows us to adjust things, make changes. 

    // The next two exercises combine the DOM with other JavaScript you've learned. Try them for an extra challenge!

    // Exercise 10: Select the elements with the class "myClass" and update the text inside each of them to end with "!"
    // Hint: To operate on multiple elements, you can use a loop.
    //get element with class myClass
    let myClassElement = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");
    // check length of myClassElement
    console.log("Length = " + myClassElement.length);
    //create for loop to go through the elements to add !
    for( i = 0; i < myClassElement.length; i++){
      //print out element we are working on
      console.log(myClassElement[i]);
      //get the text from 
      let myClassText = myClassElement[i].innerText;
      //make sure we have the correct Text
      console.log(myClassText);
      //create variable to have ! stored in it
      let addToText = "!";
      //create newText variable that stores what we will display instead
      let newText = (myClassText + addToText);
      // test newText
      console.log(newText);
      // replace the original text with the new text 
      myClassElement[i].innerText = newText;
    } // checked using chrome, the text is changed and have ! 

    // Exercise 11: Make it so when the button2 is clicked,
    // the children of the element with id "id1" each have their text replaced with a random number 1-100
    // get the element button2
    let button2 = document.getElementById("button2");
    // when button 2 is clicked
    button2.addEventListener('click', function(){
      //utilize previous part where I got the children element of id1
      for( i = 0; i < childrenElement.length; i++){
        // create random number
        let randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random() * ( 100 - 0));
        // check number 
        console.log("random number is : " + randomNumber);
        childrenElement[i].innerText = randomNumber;
      }  
    })

    // It was a lot of fun, I did have to look up more stuff to remind myself how to use some of these DOM lines. But once I saw the reminder it was easy and fun.
